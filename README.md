# Diesease-Prediction
This predicts Diseases
To build the precision of the model, three distinctive algorithms have been utilized which are as per the following

Decision Tree algorithm
Random Forest algorithm
KNearestNeighbour algorithm
Naive Bayes algorithm


All the four Algorithms predict the disease as a result when the user enter  the symtoms of diseases.
