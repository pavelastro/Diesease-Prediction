# Diesease-Prediction
This predicts Diseases
To build the precision of the model, three distinctive algorithms have been utilized which are as per the following

```Decision Tree algorithm```
```Random Forest algorithm```
```KNearestNeighbour algorithm```
```Naive Bayes algorithm```


All the four Algorithms predict the disease as a result when the user enter  the symptoms of diseases.
